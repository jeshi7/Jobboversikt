description: Ensure job listing links are added to Utlysning.md for app visibility
globs: ["**/Utlysning.md", "**/*.md"]

# Listing Link Sync

This rule ensures that every time a new job listing is added to a company folder (typically as `Utlysning.md`), the URL to the original job advertisement is included in the metadata header. This allows the JobTracker app to display a "Se Utlysning" button.

## Triggers
- When creating a new `Utlysning.md` file.
- When creating a new "Planlagt søknad" (Planned Application).
- When moving a planned application to `Alle selskaper`.

## Requirements

1.  **Format:** The markdown file MUST start with a metadata-like header section.
2.  **Field:** The header MUST include a line starting with `* **Link:**` or `* **URL:**` followed by the full URL.

### Example Template

```markdown
# [Stillingstittel]

**[Selskapsnavn]**

*   **Frist:** [Frist]
*   **Sted:** [Sted]
*   **Link:** [Sett inn URL her]

## Om stillingen
...
```

## Actions

1.  **If URL is known:** Always insert the `* **Link:**` line immediately below the Location/Sted line.
2.  **If URL is unknown:** Insert `* **Link:** (Lim inn link her)` as a placeholder to remind the user (or yourself) to add it later.
3.  **App Compatibility:** Ensure the file is saved in a location readable by the app (e.g., `JobbTracker/Data/...` if syncing is active) or that the app's regex parser can find the "Link:" pattern.
