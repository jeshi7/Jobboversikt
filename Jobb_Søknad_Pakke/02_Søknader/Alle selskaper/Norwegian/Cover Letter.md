Dear Madeleine and the Norwegian team,

I saw your Content Developer opening and got really excited – this feels like exactly the kind of role I've been looking for. I'm a designer who loves telling stories through visuals, and the idea of doing that for a brand people actually care about? That's the good stuff.

So here's the thing. I've been working with content creation for a while now, mostly with B2C companies, small businesses and startups. Most of my work has been in branding and website design – building visual identities that work across different touchpoints, making sure everything feels cohesive. I work in Adobe Creative Suite pretty much every day – Photoshop and Illustrator are my go-tos, but I use Premiere and After Effects too when I need to make things move. I've also done photo and video work, so I'm comfortable with that side of things too. I have some experience with this kind of work, and I'd really like to build on it. And I actually enjoy the whole process, from coming up with the idea to getting it out there.

The storytelling part is what I love most. I think the best content happens when you figure out what you're really trying to say first, then build the visuals around that. Sometimes that means a quick social post. Sometimes it's something longer. The trick is making sure it feels like the same brand no matter what format you're working in.

After I've done the discovery work and figured out the direction, I use artificial intelligence in the ideation process to push for more ideas – in a safe, responsible and thoughtful way, of course. It's a tool, not a replacement. But it helps me explore angles I might not have thought of otherwise, which usually leads to better final work.

I've worked with SEO and publishing before – it's not the most glamorous part of the job, but I get why it matters. I'm pretty organized when it comes to keeping track of what goes where and when. And I'm comfortable working fast. Deadlines don't stress me out the way they used to.

Norwegian is my second language, but I'm fluent. English is my native language, so that's not an issue either. I'm used to switching between them depending on what the project needs.

The collaborative part sounds great. I've worked with marketing teams before, and I like that back-and-forth you get when you're actually in the same room – or on the same video call – throwing ideas around. I'm pretty good at taking feedback without taking it personally, which helps when you're working on tight timelines.

Travel? I'm definitely up for that. I believe it builds character and broadens your knowledge – there's something about seeing how things work in different places that changes how you think about everything else.

I think what I'm trying to say is: I like making things. I like making things that work. And I'd really like to do that for Norwegian.

My CV is attached if you want to see the details. I'd love to chat more about how I could fit into your team.

Best regards,
Jessie Macharia
