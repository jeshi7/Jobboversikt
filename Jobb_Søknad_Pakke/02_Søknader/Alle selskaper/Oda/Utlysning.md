# UX Designer

## Om stillingen

**At Oda, we develop affordable grocery services to make the logistics of living surprisingly easy. First, we built Norway’s leading online grocery service. Now, partnered with Mathem in Sweden, we deliver to thousands of homes and businesses across Scandinavia every week. We’re on a mission to become the world’s most efficient grocery system, so everyone can have more space for life.**

**We’re looking for a UX Designer for a temporary position to join Oda!**

We have some parental leaves coming up, and we need an experienced UX designer to step in as a hands-on designer and project lead for 2026.

You’ll join our large 27-member Shop product team, who is responsible for literally everything customer-facing in the Oda and Mathem services: the apps, webshop, marketing tools, notifications, payment, accounts, and customer service. You’ll also touch on the tooling behind the scenes that makes this possible. It’s a huge domain responsibility, but it means we can truly design holistically, end-to-end, as we should.

As it would be nuts to have 27 people work on one project, Shop breaks up into smaller cross-functional groups to work on projects. We need you to take the lead on some of these projects from start to finish, taking ownership of the product process from initial customer insight through concept, interface design, prototyping, implementation, and testing. You’ll work closely with developers, data folks, and other designers in our Shop platform team, get the overall support from the Shop PMs, and be part of the larger Oda design discipline.

This is a one-year temporary position, from January 1 to December 31, 2026. You must be based in or near Oslo and work from our office at Tøyen. 

We’re reviewing applications (and portfolios) as they come in, so don’t wait to apply! 📮

**What you’ll be doing as a UX Designer** 
* **Lead projects from start to finish:** Take ownership of projects from the initial idea through concept, design, prototyping, implementation and testing, working closely with product managers, developers, and other team members.
* **Design customer-facing solutions and the back-end tooling to support them:** Create digital experiences for web and mobile that help make life easier for Scandinavian families—ordering weekly groceries, discovering new products, managing accounts, and getting deliveries smoothly.
* **Run user research and usability testing:** Conduct customer interviews, usability tests, and gather feedback to inform and validate your designs.
* **Create clear and usable interfaces:** Design user interfaces within our design system, ensuring clarity, usability, and consistency across platforms.
* **Collaborate across disciplines:** Work closely with product managers, developers, and other designers to bring ideas to life.

**Din vinkel:**
Trekk frem prosjektledelse og eierskap fra start til slutt - de trenger noen som kan "ta eierskap til produktprosessen fra innsikt til testing". Vektlegg designsystemer og hvordan du jobber innenfor et system, siden de har et eget designsystem. Emfaser tverrfaglig samarbeid med utviklere og datafolk. Vis at du kan drive brukerresearch og usability testing. Kort sagt: prosjektledelse + designsystemer + tverrfaglig samarbeid + brukerresearch.
